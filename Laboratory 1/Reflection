The design principle I found most important was contrast as it helped highlight information. Contrast made deisgning easier to
understand. Properly utilizing such technique leads the viewers eye into things they should see/understand. The easiert part of 
canva is editing and the hardest part is being creative in layouting. Choosing the palette and fonts were hard for me as 
they are important in the design, they should compliment each other.
